<h1>Dinosaurus/h1>
<p>Dinosaur is my son's favorite animal. Dinosaurs lived more than 200 million years ago.</p>
<p>They were divided into predors and herbivores.</p>
<p>Among the predators the most famous were tyrannosaurus Rex, allosaurus, spinosaurus, pteranodon.</p>
<p>Tyranosaurus Rex was the scariest and most powerful dinosaur. Its height reached 5 m and length 15 m.</p>
<p>Among the herbivores the most famous were triceratops, stegosaurus, diplodocus, brontosaurus.</p>
<p>Since my son loves dinosaurs, he has dinosaur toys, clothes with dinosaurs. He watches movies and cartoons with them.</p>
<p>Maksim know all the names and differences between dinosaurs.</p>
